# BlackwallV2 Optimization Plan

## Overview

Based on our profiling results, this document outlines the optimization strategy for BlackwallV2's core biomimetic algorithms. The goal is to ensure the system is robust and efficient before integrating the LLM component.

## Priority Optimization Targets

### 1. Content-Based Memory Consolidation (0.0084s avg)

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Inefficient similarity calculations using string operations
- Slow set operations (union, intersection) for text comparison
- Linear time complexity for comparing memory items

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Implement MinHash or Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for faster similarity detection
- Replace set operations with more efficient data structures
- Add early termination for obviously dissimilar content
- Pre-process and index text content for faster comparison
- Consider using a vector-based approach with TF-IDF or word embeddings

### 2. List Operations (0.0084s avg)

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Linear search time in lists
- Inefficient sorting and filtering operations
- Repeated operations on the same data

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Replace lists with dictionaries for O(1) lookups
- Implement indexing for common access patterns
- Use specialized data structures (e.g., collections.defaultdict)
- Cache results of frequently performed operations
- Consider using NumPy arrays for numerical operations

### 3. Dictionary Operations (0.0033s avg)

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Unoptimized hash functions for memory objects
- Inefficient access patterns

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Optimize key structures for memory objects
- Implement specialized indexes for content and tag searches
- Use defaultdict for grouping operations
- Review and optimize common access patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Memory Consolidation Optimization

1. Create optimized similarity calculation function:
   - Implement MinHash algorithm for faster text similarity
   - Add early termination for dissimilar content
   - Pre-process text to reduce comparison time

2. Update memory consolidation methods:
   - Replace string-based comparison with optimized version
   - Implement batch processing for memory items
   - Add caching for intermediate results

### Phase 2: Memory Structure Optimization

1. Optimize LongTermMemory structure:
   - Implement indexing for tags and content
   - Optimize memory retrieval operations
   - Add specialized structures for fast querying

2. Optimize ShortTermMemory structure:
   - Update memory storage to use efficient data structures
   - Improve memory filtering and sorting operations

### Phase 3: Fragment Processing Optimization

1. Enhance fragment routing:
   - Optimize signal distribution
   - Implement priority-based processing
   - Reduce overhead in the routing system

2. Optimize event system:
   - Improve event delivery mechanism
   - Reduce signal processing overhead

## Success Metrics

- Reduce memory consolidation time by at least 50%
- Improve overall system responsiveness
- Decrease memory usage for key operations
- Ensure all optimizations maintain full compatibility with existing interfaces

## Testing Approach

1. Run profiling before and after each optimization
2. Verify that all system tests still pass
3. Compare performance metrics from profiling results
4. Ensure memory usage does not increase significantly

## Timeline

1. Phase 1: 3-5 days
2. Phase 2: 4-7 days
3. Phase 3: 3-5 days
4. Testing and refinement: 2-3 days

## Next Steps

1. Implement MinHash algorithm for memory similarity calculation
2. Update memory data structures
3. Re-profile system after initial optimizations
