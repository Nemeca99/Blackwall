```

The architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Biomimetic Design**: System components mirror biological counterparts for intuitive function
2. **Signal-Based Communication**: Components communicate through a signal system that mimics neural pathways
3. **Fragment Identity System**: Multiple specialized cognitive fragments work together
4. **Dual-Hemisphere Memory**: Separate short-term and long-term memory systems
5. **Heartbeat-Driven Processing**: A central timing mechanism for coordinated operations
