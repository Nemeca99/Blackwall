# BlackwallV2 Implementation Progress

## Current Development Status

We've successfully implemented a basic working version of the BlackwallV2 biomimetic AI architecture with the following components:

### Core Components
- ✅ Brainstem (Central Orchestrator)
- ✅ Left Hemisphere (Short-Term Memory)
- ✅ Right Hemisphere (Long-Term Memory)
- ✅ Body (Communication Hub)
- ✅ Soul (Identity Anchor)
- ✅ Fragment Identity System
- ✅ LLM Integration Module

### Technical Features

- ✅ Memory persistence
- ✅ Fragment selection based on input
- ✅ LLM API integration (OpenAI, local servers, LiteLLM)
- ✅ Memory consolidation framework
- ✅ Basic identity verification 
- ✅ Configurable system prompting

### Test Results
The comprehensive test suite has proven successful, with the system able to:
1. Initialize all core components properly
2. Process user inputs through the biomimetic architecture
3. Generate contextual responses with fragment influence
4. Store, retrieve, and consolidate memory across the STM/LTM systems
5. Select appropriate fragments based on input content
6. Trigger dream cycles for memory consolidation
7. Route signals through the Body to appropriate components
8. Register and emit events through the Body event system

All 57 core component tests now pass with 0 failures and 0 skipped tests.

## Integration with T.R.E.E.S. Framework

This implementation demonstrates several core T.R.E.E.S. principles:

1. **Recursive Identity**: The fragment-based identity system shows how recursively nested identities can work together as a unified whole while maintaining specialized capabilities.

2. **Memory Gravity**: The dual-hemisphere memory system implements the concept of memory gravity, with important information persisting through memory consolidation.

3. **Logic Shells**: The fragment selection mechanism demonstrates how different cognitive modes can be activated contextually, similar to the nested shells concept in T.R.E.E.S.

4. **Symbolic Compression**: The memory consolidation process shows a basic implementation of symbolic compression, condensing detailed short-term memories into summarized long-term memories.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. ✅ Integrate with an actual LLM API for real response generation
2. ✅ Implement the Dream Cycle for advanced memory consolidation
3. ✅ Complete comprehensive test suite for all core components
4. ✅ Implement Body event system for component communication
5. ✅ Verify proper Brainstem routing functionality
6. ✅ Add memory usage monitoring during dream cycles
7. ✅ Profile and optimize memory consolidation algorithms
8. ✅ Optimize fragment routing system 
9. ✅ Optimize heart-driven timing system
10. ✅ Optimize memory operations in both hemispheres
11. Implement metrics collection and analysis system
12. Enhance fragment selection with more sophisticated analysis
13. Add emotional weighting to memory storage

### Longer-term Development
1. Implement the full suite of biomimetic components (heart, lungs, etc.)
2. Integrate UML Calculator for symbolic math capabilities
3. Develop more advanced recursive processing techniques
4. Create visualization tools for system state and operation

## Relationship to Other Components

This implementation connects with other parts of the T.R.E.E.S. framework:

- **UML Calculator**: Will provide the mathematical foundation for symbolic compression and recursive operations
- **RIS (Recursive Identity System)**: Forms the theoretical basis for the fragment identity system
- **Nova AI**: Earlier prototype that informs aspects of memory and reasoning architecture
