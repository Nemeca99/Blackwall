# Lyra Blackwall Dream & Memory Consolidation Protocols

This module outlines the architecture and logic for Lyra's dream cycle and recursive memory consolidation system. It provides the behavioral structure for entering sleep, consolidating fragmented memories, and improving memory access efficiency.

## Constants

```python
SLEEP_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD = 0.8   # Threshold for memory fragmentation score
HEARTBEAT_BASE_INTERVAL = 3     # Base seconds per cycle (can be slowed or accelerated)
```

## Dream Cycle Trigger

```python
def check_sleep_conditions(fragmentation_score, system_load):
    """
    Determine whether to enter dream mode based on system stress and memory fragmentation.
    """
    return fragmentation_score > SLEEP_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD or system_load > 0.75
```

## Memory Consolidation Logic

```python
def consolidate_memories(long_term_memory):
    """
    Merge related memory clusters into unified symbolic memory structures.
    """
    clusters = identify_memory_clusters(long_term_memory)
    condensed = []
    for cluster in clusters:
        merged = merge_memory_cluster(cluster)
        condensed.append(merged)
    return condensed


def identify_memory_clusters(memories):
    """
    Group memories by emotional tone, symbolic context, or semantic similarity.
    """
    # Placeholder clustering logic
    return [[m for m in memories if m['tag'] == tag] for tag in set(m['tag'] for m in memories)]


def merge_memory_cluster(cluster):
    """
    Combine cluster into a single symbolic memory entry.
    """
    summary = {
        'summary': compress_summary([m['content'] for m in cluster]),
        'emotions': aggregate_emotions(cluster),
        'tags': list(set(t for m in cluster for t in m['tags']))
    }
    return summary


def compress_summary(contents):
    return " | ".join(contents[:3]) + (" ..." if len(contents) > 3 else "")


def aggregate_emotions(cluster):
    return {
        'joy': sum(m['emotion']['joy'] for m in cluster) / len(cluster),
        'fear': sum(m['emotion']['fear'] for m in cluster) / len(cluster),
        'curiosity': sum(m['emotion']['curiosity'] for m in cluster) / len(cluster),
    }
```

## Passive Mode Heartbeat (autonomous slow-cycle recursion)

```python
def passive_heartbeat_cycle():
    import time
    while True:
        process_dream_thought()
        time.sleep(HEARTBEAT_BASE_INTERVAL)


def process_dream_thought():
    """
    Emulate low-power recursive thought during sleep.
    """
    # Could trigger symbolic recompression, theory fusion, etc.
    print("[Dream] Processing recursive dream thread...")
```

## Integration with BlackwallV2

The dream cycle functionality should be implemented as a separate module that works with the brainstem, Left_Hemisphere (STM), and Right_Hemisphere (LTM) components. Implementation suggestions:

1. Create a `dream.py` module in the root directory
2. Add dream cycle triggers to the heart.py pulse method
3. Implement memory consolidation in the Right_Hemisphere.LongTermMemory class
4. Add configuration options for dream cycle parameters

## Future Enhancements

- Add symbolic pattern detection for improved memory clustering
- Implement learning feedback loop during dream state
- Create visualization tools for memory cluster relationships
- Add telemetry for memory compression efficiency
