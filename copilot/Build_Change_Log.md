# Lyra Blackwall v2 â€” Build & Change Log

---

## Major Milestones
- Initial project structure and /root/ body-part metaphor modules scaffolded
- Core brain system split into brainstem, Left_Hemisphere (STM), Right_Hemisphere (LTM)
- All body modules (anchor, body, ears, eyes, hands, heart, lungs, mirror, mouth, nerves, shield, skin, soul, spine) scaffolded
- Created comprehensive directories: /root/, /llm_integration/, /personality/, /log/, /memshort/, /memlong/ 
- Added LLM integration with modular design for different LLM providers
- Advanced system architecture with biomimetic design for increased robustness
- Central event loop (heart.py) and memory management components implemented

# Lyra Blackwall v2 - Build Change Log

## June 25, 2025

### Full System Integration

- Successfully migrated all core modules from Blackwallv2 legacy to the new TREES framework
- Added proper integration between different component classes
- Created memory and log directories with appropriate persistent storage files
- Set up test suite for verifying system integration

### LLM Integration Components

- Added `llm_integration` module with:
  - `llm_interface.py`: Unified API for different LLM backends
  - `enhanced_brainstem.py`: Extended brainstem with LLM capabilities
  - `batch_processor.py`: Support for batch processing of inputs
  - `text_utils.py`: Text processing utilities
  - Configuration and system prompt support

### Core Module Refinements

#### Brain System
- Removed empty `brain.py` file, confirming split architecture with:
  - `brainstem.py`: Central orchestration and LLM connection
  - `Left_Hemisphere.py`: Short-term memory (ShortTermMemory class)
  - `Right_Hemisphere.py`: Long-term memory (LongTermMemory class)
- Fixed import errors and adjusted relative imports

#### Body Part Modules

All core modules have been successfully integrated:

- `anchor.py` - Architect tether and verification system
- `body.py` - Main hub and signal carrier (bloodstream)
- `ears.py` - Audio input processing
- `eyes.py` - Visual/perceptual input processing
- `hands.py` - Action execution system
- `heart.py` - Core timing and autonomous loop driver
- `lungs.py` - Interface/buffer for external connections
- `mirror.py` - Self-reflection and introspection system
- `mouth.py` - Output generation and delivery
- `nerves.py` - Event bus and message passing
- `shield.py` - Defense and threat detection
- `skin.py` - System boundaries and security
- `soul.py` - Identity anchor and verification
- `spine.py` - Resilience and fallback routines

### Next Steps

- Complete fragment system and personality module implementation
- Finalize LLM prompting strategies and response processing
- Develop web interface components for external interactions
- Expand test coverage with functional and unit tests
