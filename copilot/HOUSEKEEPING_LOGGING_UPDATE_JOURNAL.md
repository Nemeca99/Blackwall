# Logging System Standardization Journal - June 26, 2025

## Overview

As part of the ongoing housekeeping efforts for the BlackwallV2 project, we've standardized the logging system across all demo scripts. This ensures:

1. Consistent log formatting
2. Proper log file locations (all logs now go to the `log/` directory)
3. Better maintainability and organization
4. Timestamped log files for easier tracking and debugging

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Standardized Logging Module

Created a new module `demo/demo_logging.py` that provides standardized logging functionality:

- `setup_demo_logger()`: Sets up a logger with consistent formatting and output to both console and file
- `DemoLogger`: A compatibility class for existing demo scripts
- `print_and_log()`: Helper function to maintain compatibility with existing code

### 2. Updated Demo Scripts

Modified the following demo files to use the new standardized logging system:

- `demo/memory_monitoring_demo.py`
- `demo/fragment_routing_demo.py`
- `demo/dream_cycle_demo.py`
- Other demo scripts requiring log standardization

### 3. Key Improvements

- **Standardized Log Format**: All logs now follow the same format: `[TIMESTAMP] LEVEL: MESSAGE`
- **Centralized Log Storage**: All logs are now stored in the `log/` directory
- **Timestamped Filenames**: Log files now include timestamps in their filenames
- **Simplified API**: Simplified the logging API for developers

### 4. Example of New Log Format

## Benefits

- **Better Debug Experience**: Centralized, consistently formatted logs make debugging easier
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Removed duplicate logging code across demo files
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to logging behavior can now be made in one place
- **Organization**: All logs are now in a dedicated directory rather than scattered

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing log rotation to prevent log files from growing too large
- Add log level configuration via command line arguments for all demos
- Consider integrating with a more robust logging system for production use
