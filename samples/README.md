# Media Integration Samples

This directory contains sample media files that can be used with the media integration demonstration.

## Required Sample Files

For the demonstration script to work properly, the following files should be placed in this directory:

### Images
- `sunset.jpg` - An image of a sunset
- `forest_image.jpg` - An image of a forest

### Audio
- `ocean_waves.mp3` - A recording of ocean waves
- `piano_music.mp3` - A piano music recording

### Video
- `trees_video.mp4` - A video showing trees in the wind
- `dance_video.mp4` - A video of a dance performance

## Note

If actual media files are not available, the demonstration will still run using mock implementations that simulate the behavior with placeholder data.

The media feature extraction module is designed to work with both real media files (when available) and mock implementations for demonstration purposes.
