# Media Integration for BlackwallV2

This module enhances the BlackwallV2 (Lyra) system with media-specific components, enabling efficient processing of diverse media types (images, audio, video, text) using UML principles.

## Components

### 1. Media Feature Extraction

The `media_feature_extraction.py` module provides a comprehensive set of tools for extracting meaningful features from different media types:

- Text: Semantic analysis, keyword extraction, and UML-based text fingerprinting
- Images: Visual feature extraction with tesseract-based UML mapping
- Audio: Spectral analysis, rhythm detection, and harmonic UML transformation
- Video: Frame analysis, temporal patterns, and motion feature extraction

All features are transformed through UML principles to create a unified representation.

### 2. Media-Enhanced Memory

The `media_enhanced_memory.py` module extends the optimized memory systems with:

- Media-specific indices for efficient retrieval
- Cross-modal association capability
- Feature-based similarity search
- UML fingerprint-based memory optimization

This enables the system to create connections between different media types and retrieve related content across modalities.

### 3. Media-Aware Fragment Routing

The `media_aware_routing.py` module enhances the fragment routing system to:

- Dynamically adjust fragment weights based on media type
- Direct different media types to appropriate specialized fragments
- Track media processing metrics
- Optimize fragment collaboration for multi-modal content

### 4. Integration Tools

The `integration/media_integration.py` module provides tools to:

- Integrate all media-enhanced components into the BlackwallV2 system
- Register the media feature extractor
- Switch between optimized and media-enhanced components
- Monitor integration status

## Getting Started

To integrate the media components into your BlackwallV2 system:

```python
from integration.media_integration import integrate_all_media_components

# Integrate all media components
integrate_all_media_components()
```

To restore the standard optimized components:

```python
from integration.media_integration import restore_optimized_components

# Restore standard optimized components
restore_optimized_components()
```

## Demo

A demonstration script is provided in `media_integration_demo.py`. Run it to see the media components in action:

```
python media_integration_demo.py
```

The demo showcases:
- Feature extraction for different media types
- Media-enhanced memory storage and cross-modal retrieval
- Media-aware fragment routing

## Sample Media

Sample media files can be placed in the `samples/` directory. See the README in that directory for details.

## Next Steps

1. Develop real media test datasets
2. Implement full UML transformations for each media type
3. Enhance cross-modal associations with more sophisticated algorithms
4. Integrate with the LLM interface for natural language interaction with media
5. Implement media-specific optimization metrics and benchmarking

## UML Integration

This module implements the media integration plan outlined in the `MEDIA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` document, applying UML principles to create a unified mathematical framework for understanding and processing diverse media types.

The core UML transformations enable the system to:

1. Extract symbolic patterns from different media types
2. Create recursive compression of media features
3. Establish cross-modal symbolic representations
4. Apply TFID anchoring to media feature vectors
