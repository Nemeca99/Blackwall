# BlackwallV2 Project

BlackwallV2 is an advanced biomimetic cognitive architecture designed for complex task handling, memory management, and adaptive learning.

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive framework for building AI systems with components inspired by human cognitive processes, including:

- Short and long-term memory systems
- Memory consolidation via dream cycles
- Heart-like system for controlling system rhythm
- Fragment-based personality modules
- Media integration for processing various data formats
- Context-aware routing system

## Key Features & Subsystems

### Core Components

- **Heart System**: Controls the rhythm and operational flow of the system
- **Hemispheres**: Left (short-term) and Right (long-term) memory management
- **Brainstem**: Handles base-level system functions and automatic processes
- **Router**: Directs signals and processing through the system based on context

### Advanced Features

- **Dream Cycle**: Memory consolidation and insight generation during idle periods
- **Fragment System**: Modular personality components with specialized capabilities
- **Media Integration**: Process and understand various media formats (images, audio, etc.)
- **Monitoring Tools**: Performance tracking and visualization dashboards
