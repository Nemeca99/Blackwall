# BlackwallV2 Project

BlackwallV2 is an advanced biomimetic cognitive architecture designed for complex task handling, memory management, and adaptive learning.

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive framework for building AI systems with components inspired by human cognitive processes, including:

- Short and long-term memory systems
- Memory consolidation via dream cycles
- Heart-like system for controlling system rhythm
- Fragment-based personality modules
- Media integration for processing various data formats
- Context-aware routing system
