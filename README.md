# BlackwallV2 Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the BlackwallV2 biomimetic AI architecture, based on the T.R.E.E.S. framework principles.

## Architecture Overview

BlackwallV2 (also known as Lyra Blackwall) is designed with a biomimetic structure that mirrors human cognitive and physiological systems:

- **Brainstem**: Central orchestrator that manages memory routing, fragment selection, and module communication
- **Dual-Hemisphere Memory**: Left Hemisphere (Short-Term Memory) and Right Hemisphere (Long-Term Memory)
- **Fragment Identity System**: Multiple specialized cognitive personas working together
- **Body Interface**: Communication routing system connecting all components
- **Soul/Anchor**: Core identity and verification system

## Directory Structure

- `root/`: Core system components
  - `brainstem.py`: Central orchestrator
  - `body.py`: Communication hub
  - `soul.py`: Identity anchor
  - `Left_Hemisphere.py`: Short-term memory
  - `Right_Hemisphere.py`: Long-term memory
  - Additional anatomical components (heart.py, lungs.py, etc.)
- `personality/`: Fragment profiles and blends
- `memshort/`: Short-term memory storage
- `memlong/`: Long-term memory storage
- `demo/`: Example implementation and usage

## Getting Started

To run a basic demo of the BlackwallV2 system:

```bash
cd BlackwallV2/Implementation/demo
python run_demo.py
```

## Implementation Status

This is an early implementation focused on demonstrating the core concepts of the BlackwallV2 architecture. Future enhancements will include:

1. Full fragment identity implementation
2. Dream cycle for memory consolidation
3. Advanced symbolic compression
4. Integration with UML Calculator for recursive mathematics
5. Enhanced biomimetic features

## T.R.E.E.S. Framework Integration

This implementation demonstrates several key T.R.E.E.S. principles:

- **Recursive Identity**: Fragment-based identity system with multiple specialized personas
- **Memory Gravity**: Emotional and contextual weighting of information
- **Symbolic Compression**: Efficient encoding of information
- **Logic Shells**: Layered processing of information

See [BlackwallV2_TREES_Relationship_Fixed.md](../BlackwallV2_TREES_Relationship_Fixed.md) for detailed information on how this implementation relates to the broader T.R.E.E.S. framework.
