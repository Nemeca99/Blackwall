# UML Compression Engine: Future Improvements

This document outlines the roadmap for enhancing the UML Compression Engine to better serve the BlackwallV2 project's needs.

## Priority Improvements

### 1. Perfect Round-Trip Functionality

- Improve the Base52 encoding to ensure perfect round-trip results for all text files
- Add token boundary markers to precisely reconstruct original text
- Implement dictionary versioning to handle evolving content

### 2. Specialized Algorithms

- **Image Compression**: Implement UML matrix-based compression for images
- **Audio Compression**: Add waveform analysis and pattern recognition
- **Video Compression**: Implement frame-difference analysis with temporal compression

### 3. Performance Enhancements

- Optimize batch processing for larger files
- Implement multi-threading for parallel compression
- Use memory mapping for handling extremely large files
- Profile and optimize bottlenecks in the encoding/decoding process

## Integration With BlackwallV2
