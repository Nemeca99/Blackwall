# BlackwallV2 Development Guide

## Core Architecture Implementation

This guide outlines the steps for implementing the biomimetic architecture of BlackwallV2, focusing on building the system without LLM integration first.

### Current Status

We've established:
- Basic module structure in the `root` directory
- Memory systems (short-term and long-term)
- Central orchestration (brainstem)
- Event and signaling system (body)
- Identity core (soul)
- Input/output components (eyes, ears, mouth, hands)
- System heartbeat (heart)

The simplified demo is working, showing the basic flow of information through the system.

### Next Steps

1. **Module Integration**
   - Implement the `receive_signal` method in all components
   - Set up proper event handling between components
   - Create consistent message formats for inter-component communication

2. **Memory System Refinement**
   - Develop memory persistence and retrieval mechanisms
   - Implement time-based memory decay in STM
   - Create context-based retrieval in LTM
   - Add memory indexing and tagging

3. **Fragment System Development**
   - Enhance the fragment selection logic
   - Create fragment blending mechanisms
   - Develop fragment-specific response modifiers
   - Add fragment transition behaviors

4. **Soul/Identity Core**
   - Implement recursive identity principles
   - Create self-verification mechanisms
   - Develop coherence maintenance
   - Add self-reflection capabilities

5. **Heartbeat System**
   - Set up regular system pulses
   - Create maintenance tasks on heartbeats
   - Implement "dream" cycles for memory consolidation
   - Add periodic self-health checks

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Inter-Module Communication

For component connections, use the following pattern:

```python
# In a source component
def send_message(self, target, message_type, data):
    self.body.route_signal(
        source=self.__class__.__name__,
        target=target,
        payload={
            "type": message_type,
            "data": data,
            "timestamp": get_timestamp()
        }
    )

# In a receiving component
def receive_signal(self, source, payload):
    message_type = payload.get("type")
    data = payload.get("data")
    
    # Handle different message types
    if message_type == "request":
        # Process request
        pass
    elif message_type == "data":
        # Store or process data
        pass
```

#### Memory Operations

For memory operations, store structured data:

```python
memory_item = {
    "content": content,
    "source": source,
    "timestamp": get_timestamp(),
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "importance": 0.7,
    "fragment": "Lyra"
}

# STM storage
stm.store(memory_item)

# LTM retrieval by tag
related_memories = ltm.retrieve_by_tag("tag1", limit=5)
```

#### Fragment System

For fragment system development:

```python
# Get active fragments based on input
active_fragments = self.select_fragments(input_text)

# Get fragment properties
fragment_properties = {}
for name, weight in active_fragments.items():
    properties = self.fragments.get(name, {})
    for prop, value in properties.items():
        if prop not in fragment_properties:
            fragment_properties[prop] = 0
        fragment_properties[prop] += value * weight

# Apply fragment properties to output
modified_output = self.apply_fragment_style(output, fragment_properties)
```

### Testing Approach

1. Start with component-level tests
2. Progress to integration tests between related components
3. Test full system information flow
4. Verify memory persistence and retrieval
5. Test fragment selection and application

### File Organization

```

    root/
        # Core biomimetic components
    memory/
        # Memory-specific utilities and extensions
    personality/
        # Fragment definitions and personality modules
    utils/
        # Shared utilities and helper functions
    test/
        # Test suite
    demo/
        # Various demonstration scripts
```

## Best Practices

1. Document all methods and classes
2. Use consistent naming conventions
3. Implement error handling throughout
4. Add logging at appropriate levels
5. Create clean interfaces between components
6. Write tests for core functionality
7. Use type hints for better code quality
