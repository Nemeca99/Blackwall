[Demo] Starting new demo run.

Initializing BlackwallV2 Queue-Driven Architecture

[Router] Routing table after registration:
{'organ-1': {'name': 'Brainstem', 'type': 'processor', 'capabilities': ['input_processing', 'response_filtering', 'prepare_output'], 'id': 'organ-1'}, 'organ-2': {'name': 'Ears', 'type': 'input', 'capabilities': ['receive'], 'id': 'organ-2'}, 'organ-3': {'name': 'Mouth', 'type': 'output', 'capabilities': ['speak'], 'id': 'organ-3'}, 'organ-4': {'name': 'BackupMouth', 'type': 'output', 'capabilities': ['speak'], 'id': 'organ-4'}}
All components initialized and connected.

=== Context-Aware and Prompt-Driven Routing Demo ===

[Context Routing Demo] Starting context-aware and prompt-driven routing...
[MathOrgan] Math processing organ initialized
[LanguageOrgan] Language processing organ initialized
[MemoryOrgan] Memory organ initialized
[Context Routing Demo] Registered specialized organs:
  - MathOrgan: ['math', 'calculate']
  - LanguageOrgan: ['language', 'translate']
  - MemoryOrgan: ['memory', 'recall', 'remember']

Testing context-aware routing with specialized prompts:

[Context Routing Demo] User: Integrate x^2 from 0 to 1
[Router] Context: math detected. Routing to organ-5
[MathOrgan] Processing math request: Integrate x^2 from 0 to 1
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to MathOrgan (reason: math capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Math result: The integral of x^2 from 0 to 1 is 1/3

[Context Routing Demo] User: Translate 'hello' to French
[Router] Context: language detected. Routing to organ-6
[LanguageOrgan] Processing language request: Translate 'hello' to French
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to LanguageOrgan (reason: language capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Language result: 'hello' in French is 'bonjour'

[Context Routing Demo] User: Recall last input
[Router] Context: memory detected. Routing to organ-7
[MemoryOrgan] Processing memory request: Recall last input
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to MemoryOrgan (reason: memory capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Memory result: No memories stored yet

[Context Routing Demo] User: What is the derivative of sin(x)?
[Router] Context: math detected. Routing to organ-5
[MathOrgan] Processing math request: What is the derivative of sin(x)?
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to MathOrgan (reason: math capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Math result: The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)

[Context Routing Demo] User: Say 'hello' in Spanish
[Router] Context: language detected. Routing to organ-6
[LanguageOrgan] Processing language request: Say 'hello' in Spanish
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to LanguageOrgan (reason: language capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Language result: 'hello' in Spanish is 'hola'

[Context Routing Demo] User: Remember this: The sky is blue.
[Router] Context: memory detected. Routing to organ-7
[MemoryOrgan] Processing memory request: Remember this: The sky is blue.
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to MemoryOrgan (reason: memory capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Memory result: Remembered 'The sky is blue.'

[Context Routing Demo] User: Recall last input
[Router] Context: memory detected. Routing to organ-7
[MemoryOrgan] Processing memory request: Recall last input
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to MemoryOrgan (reason: memory capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Memory result: Last memory was 'The sky is blue.'

[Context Routing Demo] User: Add 42 and 58
[Router] Context: math detected. Routing to organ-5
[MathOrgan] Processing math request: Add 42 and 58
[Context Routing Demo] Routed to MathOrgan (reason: math capability)
[Context Routing Demo] Response: Math result: 42 + 58 = 100
