# HOUSEKEEPING COMPLETED - FILE CLEANUP & ORGANIZATION

## Duplicate Files Removed:
- ✅ `batch/check_journal.bat` (duplicate of root version)
- ✅ `scripts/organize_journals_new.py` (duplicate script)
- ✅ `memlong/copilot/` (entire duplicate copilot folder structure)
- ✅ `standalone_media_demo.py` (duplicate from root)
- ✅ `media_integration_demo.py` (duplicate from root)
- ✅ `heart_optimization_demo.py` (duplicate from root)
- ✅ `run_llm_demo.py` (duplicate from root)
- ✅ All duplicate `.bat` files from `batch/` folder
- ✅ `demo/simple_profiler.py` (duplicate)
- ✅ `demo/profile_script_simplified.py` (duplicate)

## Folders Removed:
- ✅ `batch/` folder (contained only duplicates)
- ✅ `memlong/copilot/` folder (duplicate structure)
- ✅ `optimize/temp/` folder (temporary files)

## Files Organized:
- ✅ Moved `test_integration.py` → `test/`
- ✅ Moved `test_optimized_integration.py` → `test/`
- ✅ Moved `simple_profiler.py` → `tools/`
- ✅ Moved `profile_script.py` → `tools/`
- ✅ Moved `profile_script_simplified.py` → `tools/`
- ✅ Moved `optimize_algorithms.py` → `optimize/`
- ✅ Moved `fixed_memory_consolidation.py` → `optimize/`

## Cleanup:
- ✅ Removed all `__pycache__/` directories
- ✅ Removed backup files from temp folders
- ✅ Consolidated scattered files into appropriate directories

## System Standardization

- ✅ Created standardized logging module (`demo_logging.py`)
- ✅ Updated demo scripts to use consistent logging format
- ✅ Redirected all logs to the `log/` directory
- ✅ Added timestamp to log filenames
- ✅ Created journal entry documenting logging system changes

## Result

The workspace is now cleaner with:

- No duplicate files
- Files in appropriate folders
- No unnecessary backup/temp files
- Cleaner directory structure
- Standardized logging system across demo scripts
